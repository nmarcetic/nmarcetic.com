      <h1>👋 I&#39;m Nikola.</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I’ve spent more than a decade building reliable, scalable, and secure systems across multiple industries.</p>
<p>I began my career in Web2, working on infrastructure and distributed systems, contributing to open-source projects long before stepping into the IoT world. Later, I became a co-author of the Mainflux open-source platform, a Linux Foundation project adopted as a backbone technology by enterprises such as Intel, Target, Nokia, and NOV, and presented at major industry events across Europe and Silicon Valley. Those years strengthened my passion for distributed systems, clean architecture, and solving hard real-world, mission critical problems.</p>
<p>I’ve been involved in blockchain and distributed ledger technologies since 2017, and working strictly in DeFi since 2020. Over the past several years, my focus has shifted toward engineering high-performance blockchain infrastructure, distributed systems, and developer tooling — including being an early core contributor to the <a href="https://injective.com">Injective Protocol</a>, where I worked on core architecture, protocol performance, and infrastructure. Helped scale a genesis chain to $Bn+ daily volume, 600ms blocks, 2.68B+ txns, with zero halts.</p>
<p>Today, I’m dedicated to building scalable, secure systems and blockchain infrastructure powering the future of on-chain finance. I’m driven by teams that value curiosity, low ego, clarity, and execution — environments where people move fast, experiment boldly, and push the limits of what modern financial infrastructure can become.</p>
<p>I’m always open to meaningful conversations, new challenges, and collaborations around protocol engineering, scaling L1/L2 infrastructure, validator systems, and everything that makes decentralized networks robust and performant.</p>
<h3 id="beyond-the-tech">Beyond the Tech</h3>
<p>I’m a big believer in staying sharp — mentally and physically.
I’m addicted to fitness, functional/bodyweight training, and biohacking, constantly testing new ways to optimize energy, focus, and performance.</p>
<p>When I’m AFK, you’ll usually find me outdoors: mountain biking, ATV riding, or doing something active to reset and recharge (or by the grill, fueling my BBQ obsession). A few years ago, I traded city life for a more nature-centered lifestyle, spending most days outside and more connected to the nature and family. With our third child on the way, they’re the anchor that keeps me centered, grateful, and focused on building things — in life and in work — that actually matter.</p>
<p>If this resonates, feel free to reach out — always happy to connect. 🤝</p>
