      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s all about my journey, skills, how I like to work, and research.
How I work I enjoy a remote lifestyle for the last six years. I believe in distributed teams and remote team cultures. It is the synonym for productivity and high-quality teams with top talents, most important a perfect life balance and happiness.
I use technology to solve problems and build digital products. Ideas and innovations are the biggest motivation for me.</description>
