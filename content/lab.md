This page is a snapshot of what I build, how I think, and what I’m currently exploring.
A mix of craft, engineering philosophy, and the systems I spend my time improving.

## How I Work

I’ve been working remotely for years, and I genuinely believe distributed teams build the best systems. Autonomy, clarity, ownership, and deep focus matter more than offices ever will.

I like working with people who move fast, communicate openly, and keep their ego out of the way. Teams where execution beats politics, and where strong ideas rise through data, not volume.

I’ve worked across startups and enterprise environments, and while both worlds teach you different lessons, I naturally gravitate toward the builder energy of startups and early-stage teams — where clarity, pace, and ownership matter the most.

## Technologies & Craft

I retired my JavaScript/Python era a long time ago and ended up fully immersed in Go, with ongoing experiments in Rust when the problem fits.

My focus today spans:

• Distributed systems

• Blockchain infrastructure

• Protocol/consensus/performance

• Validator systems & tooling

• High-scale cloud & on-chain architectures

Kubernetes, cloud-native patterns, multi-cloud deployments, and L1/L2 infrastructure have been part of my world for years. I also keep a close eye on decentralization, confidential computing, cryptography, and anything that pushes infrastructure into its next evolution.

Technology is a tool — and I like operating at the bleading edge of what it can do.

## What I’m Working On Now

Coming soon — until then, my [Resume](../pdf/Nikola_CV.pdf) has the essentials...
