It's all about my journey, skills,  how I like to work, and research.

### How I work

I enjoy a remote lifestyle for the last six years. I believe in distributed teams and remote team cultures. It is the synonym for productivity and high-quality teams with top talents, most important a perfect life balance and happiness. 

I use technology to solve problems and build digital products. 
Ideas and innovations are the biggest motivation for me. I had an opportunity to play for both sides, startups and enterprises. We won every time, but the startup vibe is what I would choose.

### Technologies 
I hang up my JavaScript/ Python toolbelt a few years ago, fall in love with idiomatic Go, and experiments with Rust. With Cloud-native principles in mind, I am designing and developing highly scalable, truly available distributed systems. 

Kubernetes is a new kernel, multi-cloud, and day two applications are what I am passionate about. 
I am also interested in decentralization, blockchain, confidential computing, and anything that can help me in my work or idea productization. 

Technology is a tool. I like walking on the edge.
